Dear Senator Worsley,


On behalf of the staff and volunteers here at Heritage Square, I congratulate you for being a 2017 Arts Champion, and would like to thank you for making sure the State Arts Commission is receiving critical funds to support nonprofit arts and culture organizations in Arizona.  


Heritage Square is the last remaining original residential block in Phoenix.  Over time, the buildings were changed and neglected, but 38 years ago the City of Phoenix and the community came together to save the buildings on Block 14, and to create a place that speaks to Phoenix’s past, present and future.  We hold that promise at the heart of our organizational mission – to create a fun and engaging destination in the heart of Phoenix through preservation, education, events and memorable experiences.  To preserve the setting and structures and present historical interpretations of the people and history of the Square.


We could not fulfill this promise without the generous support of a caring and engaged community.  We invite you to Heritage Square, to see community preservation and involvement at work!  Thank you again for your support of Arizona nonprofits.


Most sincerely,






Michelle R. Reid
Executive Director
Heritage Square Foundation

Next Meeting
February 20, 2013
11:00am
Downtown Phoenix Partnership Office


Focus Areas for ZW5 Improvements:
1. Photo Release Disclaimers stationed throughout the event so there isn’t a need for a registration booth/waivers to sign in for adults.  Waivers only signed for children under 18.
2. Need an Information Booth, combined with Food Donation drop-off and Make-Up application that is open all night long
3. Need more security, and they need to be wearing more distinguishable attire.
4. Moving Adult Interactive Zone to Monroe. To include paintball or laser tag and the suns truck
5. Rolling Vendor registration into sponsorship package and therefore having more control over the vendors and their arrivals and departures from the event
6. Adding a second smaller stage to Monroe
7. Adding more interaction areas along the route. Bands, Paparazzi Alley, etc.
8. Little Zombie Zone to include food vendors and potentially having activities for kids after the walk.
9.  Organize Pre-zombie walk events e.g. Zombie Queen Pageant
10.  Inclusion of more zombie themed organizations like Roller Derby, United Zombies of America, Food Trucks
11.  Logistics: cut fencing needs, move the dumpster into the event, more attention to clean up after event
12. Revisit Time of actual walk – possibly later than dusk and including a “family walk” earlier
13.  Focus on actual costs of event, and create a Sponsorship package to cover all costs – delegate one partner to handle the event financials.
14.  Overall goal of all partners is to not incur a cost and keep the event free for the public.
15.  Start in February to go after sponsors and assign committees and committee chairs.




2013 Meeting Agenda
1. Sponsorship Package Approval
   1. Confirm all costs covered in pricing amounts based on each partner’s P&L from Zombie Walk 4 and Zombie Walk 5 Financial increase projections.
2. Compile a list of Sponsors to go after
3. Assign Committees and Committee Chairs
RECAP MEETING MINUTES
Donny – Clicker count 6,400 (counters were not started at the beginning of the event)


Improvements:
        Donny: More security 
Tammy: Security labeled better so more identifiable
* Make Security Shirts
Donny: Make sure to have security at the start of the walk to make sure alcohol doesn’t leave the event
Donny: More people stationed throughout the event  (at the far ends by Rose & Crown) to tell all attendees that the walk is starting.
        RJ: Corrals could be a way to solve this issue


RJ: Registration – had to abandon early, it was hard to continually communicate why needed to register, and also knowing the difference between who was registered and who was not
RJ: Next Year – no registration tent, just disclaimers though out the park to reference 
Evelyn – Most people stopping by Kids Science Center did not sign the event release forms
RJ: Keep Signing of forms for Kids zone, because it’s more sensitive when kids are involved.


Tom/Tammy: Need Information Booth open all night – Food donation drop off open all night. 
Tammy: Complaints about donating food and not getting free make-up application once Zombie walk started.
Tammy: Messaging for 2013 to have time limit or first ### people get free make-up with food donation
*RJ: Increase the presence of the food donation and make-up application area: Combine Information and Make-Up application areas and have them run all night long
Need to recruit volunteers to be there all night to apply make-up.  Need more people at start.  At least 5-10.


Anna: if you’re in a public place you do not need a photo release for adults, just need to sign photo release for kids under 18


Tom: Fencing in the wrong place – no need for fencing on Monroe.  Just need to tell ASU to close gates on Mercado and that will act as a physical barrier.
Tammy:* Don’t need to go behind Bianco, just need the fence in front of Bianco
        Donny to update where the fencing should be for 2013


Tom: Needed more trash pick up throughout the night – Tables cleaned and garbage cans emptied.


Tom: Should use the radio station to make announcements in the Little Zombie Zone.

Evelyn: Moving the Little Zombie Zone into the Lath House was good, with the natural barrio as well as the shade.

Tammy: Just have a donation booth
        Evelyn: Open 30 minutes later and close 30 minutes later.  It was packed
Leigh: The Paint Ball noises was a little too loud for the kids.
Evelyn: The placement of the Science Center couldn’t hear the paint ball noises
        Sam: Will talk with PePe about having Laser Tag vs. Paintball
* Should Charge for it, it was really .  Pepe was open to the idea of charging 
Jeff: Move the Paintball attraction into Monroe – 


Movie Projection
FB: The end of the night were at Rose & Crown were watching the movie.
Placement was more for ambiance as opposed to a sit down and viewing of a complete movie.


Tom: Suns truck didn’t work as it was, placement, they came in late, had to leave early, too close to the stage, needed lighting 
        Donny – put it in the Kids zone
        Tammy – Put them on Monroe as the “Interactive Adult Zone”
Sara – Make sure the placements of all vendors on Monroe are not within the load out area for Little Zombie Zone


        Leigh: Get Roller Derby girls to attend – They is a zombie themed team

        TJ: Add another stage on Monroe
                Jeff: Couldn’t hear the main stage at all from Monroe
                Donny: Told them to turn it up, and their sound was maxed out.
                RJ: Two stages would help band load in and load out – 


RJ: Need to reorganize the Vendor Situation
                Need to charge more
                Need more Zombie specific vendors
                Donny – move Candy Apple vendor to Kid zone
RJ: Vendors need more clarity on what the regulations are – when can load in and specific times you can load out.
Tom: Need people on both entrances directing load in and load out.
Donny: The event needs to be ready to go at the very beginning of the event.
Anna – Need to be set up earlier because there’s a traffic jam right before the beginning. 
Sara: Load in Load out needs to be more organized, communication with vendors on when to arrive needs to be more clear.  Volunteers need to know exactly what to tell vendors as their loading in.

Require profit report after event to be more particular about vendor selection


Jeff: Food Trucks
                Heard a lot about inclusion of food trucks and why they weren’t there
                Donny: Food Trucks have a huge benefit from being involved, and 
Tom/TJ: Issues only arise with load in and load out.
Donny: Food trucks also will go to the event that’s the biggest, and so you need to have the commitment early


Sam: Route was great
        The change PD made to go down Van Buren was perfect.
        PD was good with the route
Making sure next year the route is called a “parade” so costs will be covered by the city
        *Pacing needs to be sped up especially in the front.
        Sara – figuring out corrals for 2013 might help this
        Second stage would help with this as well. (Right in front of the Mercado)
                Second Stage would entertain 
PD’s only concern was the traffic on 3rd for Herberger Theater event attendees
Curtis: Signify specific “Watch Zones” 


Sara: Need more Entertainment on the Route
        Need to confirm more interaction along the route
        Bands – there are bands who are interested
                Sam: Can plan on an hour set
        Arizona Improve
        Zombie themed, kid friendly 
Anna: Paparazzi Alley - with enough notice a certain media person could get many photographers
                Curtis – Taylor Place would be great for Paparazzi Alley
Sam: Vehicles didn’t work
        RJ: Encourage non-motorized floats to be a part of the walk.
        Sam: probably can’t fit through Arizona Center.




Sara: Second Stage on Monroe needs to be a noticeably smaller stage than the Main Stage to that the draw is to go towards the Main stage and spread out the event.


Sam: Need Kids events going on after the walk –United Zombies of America to do the plants vs Zombies
        Tom: Bounce House worked well 2011
Sara: Not encourage the kids to be there past the walk time, but have activities to separate the kids from the event.
Donny/Sam: Having activities for the teens to do after the walk.


Tom: Clean up
        Need to be better at cleaning up after the event

        Sara/Donny: Add a “Family Zombie Walk” at Dusk


Port-A Potties
        Sam: No questions it worked out well
        Tom: the checking of the port-a-potties was great
Move Dumpster location and (was an adequate size) 
        RJ: It would be better if it was closer.
        Tammy: Monore right where the hearse was placed
                Add “Biohazards Waste Zone” to Dumpster.


Money
RJ: Always been the goal to Break even, but the event has become a money making event so DPP would like to make a profit 
        Vendors need to be charged more

        Sponsors approached early
Sara: Rolling Vendor registration into the sponsorship package.
Donny: Need to have a single treasurer, all money in and out goes through one person. 
Tom – Rosson House – Heritage Square.  Can give up the vendors, as long as they continue to work with Rose & Crown on the liquor.
Donny – to get P&L for the event to DPP so we can be more aware of the costs to the event.
